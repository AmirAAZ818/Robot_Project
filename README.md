## Introduction to the Robot and its Objective:
In an era of technological advancement and commerce, warehouse management has become one of the most marginalized and evolving areas. One of the most captivating developments in this regard is the introduction of warehouse robots, which have emerged as representatives
of technological advancement in this field. These intelligent devices, utilizing artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things, and advanced sensors, have evolved into a powerful combination of intelligence, precision, and speed.

## Advantages of a Warehouse Robot:
1. Increased Productivity:
Warehouse robots, with their intelligent capabilities have enhanced the productivity of various warehouse processes. This increase in productivity not only reduces the time and costs associated with warehouse operations but also increases the ability to perform tasks simultaneously and more quickly.
2. High Precision:
Warehouse robots, utilizing barcode scanning technology and sensors, exhibit high precision in identifying and recording products. This precision reduces human errors in inventory management and order fulfillment.
3. Cost Reduction:
Increased productivity and precision lead to a reduction in operational costs associated with warehouse management. Robots play a significant role as the primary driver of business efficiency improvement.
4. Technological Transformation in Warehouse Management:
Technologies such as artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things (IoT), and machine learning have gradually entered the field of warehouse management. These advancements greatly facilitate the optimization of warehouse processes. Smart warehouses, with the ability to connect to other networks and exchange data, enable better inventory management, demand forecasting, and waste reduction. As a significant advancement in supply chain management, these technological transformations signify a bright future for improving warehouse processes and enhancing efficiency in organizations. Warehouse robots, with all their capabilities, symbolize the endless potential of technology in enhancing the efficiency and performance of modern warehouses.

## Introduction to the Functions of the Warehouse Robot:
Our team has devoted considerable effort and dedication to building an advanced version of the warehouse robot, which not only meets the basic needs of a warehouse and warehouse manager but also assists warehouse operators in intelligently and optimally managing the status of goods, inventory, and robot operation processes by upgrading warehouse processes.

## Main Objective of the Project:
The main objective of building this robot is to facilitate warehouse processes. As an intelligent collaborator, this robot is capable of performing tasks such as automatic or manual movement of boxes and loads. Additionally, this project has provided a mobile application that warehouse operators can easily use to communicate with the robot and monitor its operation status.

## Primary Functions of the Warehouse Robot:

1. Moving Loads: The warehouse robot is capable
of automatically or manually moving boxes and
loads. This feature helps warehouse operators
quickly and efficiently transport loads to their
intended destinations.

2. Inventory Checking: Using sensors and
advanced technologies, the robot can check the
inventory in the warehouse and provide
warehouse operators with accurate information
about the status of products in stock.

3. Warehouse Temperature Control: The robot has
the ability to control the temperature in the
warehouse and can assist in adjusting the
ambient temperature if necessary.

4. Warehouse Humidity Control: By using a
humidity control system, the warehouse robot
provides the capability to manage and monitor
the humidity level in the environment.

5. Smoke Detection Alert: Equipped with smoke
sensors, the warehouse robot can send an alert
to the mobile application or notify the warehouse
operators in case of smoke detection.

This initial version of the warehouse
robot is designed to address the basic
needs of a warehouse and warehouse
manager. With the continuation of the
project and the development of the
robot, it is expected that by adding
features and necessary improvements, it
will evolve into a smarter and more
efficient tool. This version is just the first
step towards improving warehouse
processes and our team will be diligently
working with full energy to advance the
project and further enhance the robot's
functionality and usability.

## How to run:
